Introduction
	There are many levels that neuroscience can be approached on, from single neurons, to systems of nuerons,
to larger anatomical regions. Even single neurons however have complex electrical and biological properties. 
These can be investigated in vitro or in vivo, but the can also be investigated in "silica",  through  
simulation. Computer simulation has certain advantages over traditional investigative methods in that it 
does not require a lab or samples. It also allows for nueral systems to be simplified and the variables 
to be tightly controlled. 
	In this project I will be simulating nuerons in the nucleus accumbens(Nac) shell that have been linked 
to addiction through several lines of evidence. I will be attempting to create different models of how the
transport protein p11(S100A10) may be effecting the surface expression of D2 receptors, and how that may be
effecting the electrical activity of these nuerons. If succesful this project will generate models testable
in vitro. 
Goals of the program:
1. Simulate nucleus accumbens shell neurons and output data about firing rate with different p11 levels and 
effects.
2. Compare the results in python and create predictions about how Nac nuerons should act with p11 acting in 
different ways.
Current Challenges: importing the nueron library into python.  This is the master folder for the new project.
